ODEPACK is a collection of Fortran solvers for the initial value problem for ordinary differential equation systems.
It consists of nine solvers, namely a basic solver called LSODE and eight variants of it -- LSODES, LSODA, LSODAR, LSODPK, LSODKR, LSODI, LSOIBT, and LSODIS.
The collection is suitable for both stiff and nonstiff systems.
It includes solvers for systems given in explicit form, dy/dt = f(t,y), and also solvers for systems given in linearly implicit form, A(t,y) dy/dt = g(t,y).
Two of the solvers use general sparse matrix solvers for the linear systems that arise.
Two others use iterative (preconditioned Krylov) methods instead of direct methods for these linear systems.
The most recent addition is LSODIS, which solves implicit problems with general sparse treatment of all matrices involved.

The ODEPACK solvers are written in standard Fortran 77, with a few exceptions, and with minimal machine dependencies.
There are separate double and single precision versions of ODEPACK.
The actual solver names are those given above with a prefix of D- or S- for the double or single precision version, respectively, i.e. DLSODE/SLSODE, etc.
Each solver consists of a main driver subroutine having the same name as the solver and some number of subordinate routines.
For each solver, there is also a demonstration program, which solves one or two simple problems in a somewhat self-checking manner.
